###Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

1. [x] Create a web page using HTML and CSS. The page should have a title, a search box, and a place where a photo gallery will be placed.

2. [x] Add the provided images to the gallery using the design in the gallery_mockup.png file.

	-The numbers and dotted lines in the mockup provide size information to help you build the project -- don't include them in your final design.

3. [ ] Find a jQuery plugin for creating a photo gallery or write your own script.
	- The gallery must include the ability to click on photos and view them in a lightbox (see the photo_lightbox.png file for the design).

4. [x] Add text captions to the images when viewed in the lightbox.

5. [x] Add back and forward buttons when the lightbox is visible to switch between photos.

6. [x] Implement the search box at the top of the page that filters photos based on the captions.
	- The photos should filter in real-time as you type.
This could be a jQuery plugin that you find on the web, or code that you write yourself.


7. [ ] Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
	- Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
	- There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
		- Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
		- If CSS validator flags use of calc, or vendor prefixes these errors should be ignored.
		- If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.

	- You should also check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the Project Resources.
	- JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems.
	- You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful.

##Extra Credit
To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

1. [ ] Expand on the design in the mockup
	-Make sure you include a thumbnail gallery, but add your own colors, fonts and other visual improvements.
2. [x] Keyboard navigation for browsing photos.
3. Support for additional media types like YouTube videos.
4. [x] Write your own JavaScript code instead of using a jQuery plugin.
5. [x] Add animation effects when filtering the gallery of photos.
